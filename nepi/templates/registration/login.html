<h5>Welcome to the ICAP Nursing E-Learning Platform</h5>
<h5>ICAP, a global leader in HIV/AIDS and health system strengthening, developed the Nursing E-Learning platform to support nursing and midwifery education and training.</h5>  <p> This platform will serve as an online hub for nursing education and training resources to be accessed by nursing education institutions, in-service training programs, and continuing professional development programs.  Supporting nursing education and training is strategic for advancing ICAP’s goal of improving the health of families and communities.</p> 

<p>The ICAP Global Nurse Capacity Building Program (GNCBP) aims to improve population health by fostering individuals, institutions, and networks to expand, enhance, and sustain the nursing and midwifery workforce in sub-Saharan Africa through two sub-projects: Nursing Education Partnership Initiative (NEPI) and General Nursing (GN). NEPI aims to strengthen the capacity of nursing and midwifery educational institutions and ensure the production of sufficient numbers of well-trained, clinically competent graduates while General Nursing promotes the maintenance of a skilled nursing workforce through on-going training.</p> 

<p>The ICAP Nursing E-Learning platform is supported with funding from the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and was developed in collaboration with the Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning (CCNMTL)
