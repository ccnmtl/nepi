Publication Date: 2011
The Campus to Clinic training curriculum was developed by ICAP in 2011 to mentor nurse educators in South Africa with expanded knowledge in HIV care and treatment and teaching methodologies so that they may adequately prepare graduating nurses for the demands of clinical work in the provision of HIV care and treatment.  The curriculum includes 36 hours of training over 9 modules of approximately 4 hours each. Topics include adult teaching and learning methods, HIV counseling and testing, adult care and treatment, pediatric care and treatment, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and sexual and reproductive health services.

Monitoring and Evaluation Tools
Three interlinked patient monitoring systems for HIV care/ART, MCH/PMTCT and TB/HIV: standardized minimum data set and illustrative tools
Source: World Health Organization
Publication Date: 2012
The patient monitoring guidelines for HIV care and ART outline a minimum data set and accompanying generic tools for data collection and reporting. More than 29 countries now use an adaptation of this generic system to support their HIV service provision and to provide important program indicators, with increasing availability of core indicators from a routine, harmonized national system. The three interlinked patient monitoring systems support integrated service provision, follow up of mother-infant pair and monitoring of key TB-related and pediatric variables. The MCH minimum data set includes all routine core maternal and infant variables plus key HIV-related variables. The generic ART cohort report has been simplified and the cross-sectional quarterly report is now integrated to collect not only HIV indicators, but also key PMTCT, MCH and TB/HIV indicators. The generic tools are illustrative, for country adaptation.

Global Plan Towards the Elimination of New HIV Infections Among Children by 2015 and Keeping Their Mothers Alive
Source: UNAIDS
Publication Date: 2011
The Global Plan was developed through a consultative process by a high level Global Task Team convened by UNAIDS and co-chaired by UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibé and United States Global AIds Coordinator Ambassador Eric Goosby.  It brought together 25 countries and 30 civil society, private sector, networks of people living with HIV and international organizations to chart a roadmap to achieving this goal by 2015. This plan covers all low- and middle-income countries, but focuses on the 22 countries* with the highest estimated numbers of pregnant women living with HIV. Exceptional global and national efforts are needed in these countries that are home to nearly 90% of pregnant women living with HIV in need of services. Intensified efforts are also needed to support countries with low HIV prevalence and concentrated epidemics to reach out to all women and children at risk of HIV with the services that they need. The Global Plan supports and reinforces the development of costed country-driven national plans. *Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
