* Translation files are located in <language>/LC_MESSAGES/django.po.
* For local development, set the fully qualified path for LOCALE_PATHS in your local_settings.py

* Regenerate messages by running make makemessages. This is not a destructive operation and will retain translations already completed. 

* Compile messages by running make compilemessages. Check in the resulting .mo files
