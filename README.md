ICAP Nursing eLearning
==========


The Nursing Education Partnership Initiative (NEPI) is an initiative developed to address the critical shortage of health care workers in sub-Saharan Africa by strengthening the quality and capacity of nurses and midwives throughout Africa. NEPI intends to strengthen the quality and capacity of nursing and midwifery education institutions, increase the number of highly skilled nurses and midwives, and support innovative nursing retention strategies in African countries. As part of the NEPI mandate, ICAP will collaborate with CCNMTL to develop and manage a new NEPI website that will facilitate communication and collaboration across NEPI partners. This website will enable the exchange of ideas and best practices, and serve as an online hub for nursing curricula and training resources. The site will also feature online webinars and courses, and provide networking tools for NEPI partners to communicate directly with one another.

Our project is funded by HRSA. NEPI as a whole is funded by multiple organizations, led by the Office of the US Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) and coordinated through ICAP-NEPI. NEPI is a demonstration program, which means that it is intended to demonstrate workable solutions to the problem of health care worker capacity. NEPI intends to address a root cause (challenged capacity), thereby ameliorating the symptoms of inadequate quantity or quality. NEPI itself is not a scale up program, but Ministry of Health ownership in each country ensures that demonstrated successes will be rolled out nationwide (sustainability).
